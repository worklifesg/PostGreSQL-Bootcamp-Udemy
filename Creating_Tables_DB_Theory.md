# Creating Tables and Databases Theoretical Concepts
These theoretical concepts are helpful in using CREATE, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, ALTER, DROP, CHECK constraint functions for making new tables and database.

## Table of Content
  * [Datatypes](#datatypes)
  * [Primary and Foriegn Key](#primary-and-foriegn-key)
  * [Constraints](#constraints)

## Datatypes
  * There are different types of data type that can be assigned different column parameter as per the need of the table. They are as follows:
    * Boolean (True/False)
    * Character (char,varchar,text)
    * Numeric (int, float)
    * Temporal (date, time, timestamp, interval)
    * UUID - Universally Unique Identifiers
    * Array - string and numbers
    * JSON
    * Hstore key-value pair
    * Other data type such as network address and geometric data
  * Example: to store phone number, we can use 'VARCHAR' instead of INTEGER as we don't have to perform any arithmetic operation
